# Task 2: Sample swaps

You are working with RNA-seq data from four tissues from two different donors. Your labmate has informed you that the donor labs on two of the samples have been swapped, but does not remember for which tissues. You are tasked with determining which samples have been swapped.


Tasks:
1. Identify which tissues have swapped donors.
2. Attach your code for determining the sample swap.
3. Write a short paragraph detailing how you came to this decision.

```{r}

# creating a sample metadata spec sheet
sample_metadata <- tibble(
    file_name = c("ENCFF338WAN", "ENCFF484GLG", "ENCFF624PWP", "ENCFF253XRU",
                 "ENCFF402FVH", "ENCFF355CVD", "ENCFF649AAK", "ENCFF491GKL"),
    donor = c("Donor_A", "Donor_B", "Donor_A", "Donor_B", "Donor_A", "Donor_B", "Donor_A", "Donor_B"),
    tissue = c("Stomach", "Stomach", "Spleen", "Spleen", "Lung", "Lung", "Colon", "Colon")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    file_path = file.path(dir_path, "rnaseq", paste0(file_name, ".tsv")),
    sample_label = paste(file_name)
    ) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
  
rownames(sample_metadata) <- sample_metadata$sample_label

print(sample_metadata)
```

Counts specifications from here: https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/rna-seq/small-rnas/ 
I'll be using the unstranded counts as the raw counts for normalization
```{r}
library(readr)

# function to read in files and drop the columns 
read_and_process_counts <- function(file_path, file_name, donor, tissue) {
    read_tsv(file_path, col_names = c("gene_id", "unstranded_counts", "read1_stranded_counts", "read2_stranded_counts")) %>%
        select(gene_id, unstranded_counts) %>%
        filter(!gene_id %in% c("N_unmapped", "N_multimapping", "N_noFeature", "N_ambiguous")) %>%
        # dplyr::rename(!!paste(file_name, donor, tissue, sep = "_") := unstranded_counts)
    dplyr::rename(!!paste(file_name) := unstranded_counts)
}

# call the function for the multiple samples
quantification_list <- pmap(
    list(sample_metadata$file_path, sample_metadata$file_name, sample_metadata$donor, sample_metadata$tissue),
    read_and_process_counts
)

quantification_df <- purrr::reduce(quantification_list, full_join, by = "gene_id")

head(quantification_df)
```

```{r}
count_matrix <- quantification_df %>%
    column_to_rownames(var = "gene_id") %>%
    as.matrix()

dim(count_matrix)

```

```{r}
library(DESeq2)

count_matrix <- round(count_matrix)

# normalize via deseq2 - just account for technical variation and tissue, since i don't want to bias the normalization based on suspicious donor labels
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
    countData = count_matrix,
    colData = sample_metadata,
    # design = ~ 1
    design = ~ tissue
)

# filter low counts overall
smallestGroupSize <- 3
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds) >= 10) >= smallestGroupSize
dds <- dds[keep,]

vsd <- vst(dds, blind=TRUE) # for no bias in design
vsd_mat <- assay(vsd)
dim(vsd_mat)
```

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(vsd_mat), scale. = TRUE)

percentVar <- pca$sdev^2 / sum(pca$sdev^2) * 100

#
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca$x) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "sample") %>%
    left_join(sample_metadata, by = c("sample" = "sample_label"))

# plot with tissue and donor 
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = tissue, shape = donor)) +
    geom_point(size=4) +
    geom_text_repel(aes(label=sample), size=3, max.overlaps = 10) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "PCA of RNA-seq Samples based Tissue and Donor",
         x = paste0("PC1: ", round(percentVar[1], 1), "% variance"),
         y = paste0("PC2: ", round(percentVar[2], 1), "% variance")) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

In the PCA plot, we see an interesting trend: samples from Donor A tend to cluster higher along PC2 than those from Donor B across most tissues—like the stomach, lung, and colon,  hints at a stable, donor-specific expression pattern across these tissues. However, the spleen samples break this pattern; Donor B’s spleen sample actually clusters higher on PC2 than Donor A’s, flipping the usual trend. This unexpected result raises a question—there might be a labeling issue with the spleen samples, given the deviation from the expected donor-specific clustering. PC1 is likely tissue-specific clustering and PC2 donor-specific.

```{r}
library(pheatmap)

# get correlation as heatmap
cor_matrix <- cor(vsd_mat)

rownames(sample_metadata) <- NULL

# correlation 
annotation_col <- sample_metadata %>%
    column_to_rownames(var = "sample_label") %>% 
    select(donor, tissue)  

pheatmap(cor_matrix,
         annotation_col = annotation_col,
         main = "Sample Correlation Heatmap",
         display_numbers = TRUE,
         fontsize_number = 8,
         clustering_distance_rows = "correlation",
         clustering_distance_cols = "correlation",
         clustering_method = "average")
```

These correlation values are relatively similar across all tissues. Interestingly, the correlation between the spleen and colon samples from Donor A and Donor B is slightly high—mirroring (0.85) the kind of correlation pattern we’d expect to see between tissues from the same donor rather than across donors. On top of that, these samples show lower correlations with other tissues from their labeled donor, hinting that they might actually belong to the opposite donor. Given the PCA observations, spleen can be the suspicious ones but it's difficult to say.

```{r}
hc <- hclust(as.dist(1 - cor_matrix), method = "average") # inconclusive

plot(hc, main = "Hierarchical Clustering of RNA-seq Samples", xlab = "", sub = "", labels = rownames(cor_matrix), cex = 0.8)
```

As expected, samples predominantly clustered based on tissue type, indicating that tissue-specific expression profiles are the main drivers of variation. 

```{r}
correlation_df <- as.table(cor_matrix) %>% as.data.frame()
colnames(correlation_df) <- c("Sample1", "Sample2", "Correlation")

correlation_df <- correlation_df %>%
  left_join(sample_metadata %>% select(sample_label, donor, tissue), by = c("Sample1" = "sample_label")) %>%
  left_join(sample_metadata %>% select(sample_label, donor, tissue), by = c("Sample2" = "sample_label"), suffix = c("_1", "_2")) 

# correlations between different donors (cross-donor, same-tissue)
cross_donor_correlations <- correlation_df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    Sample1 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", Sample2, Sample1),
    Sample2 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", Sample1, Sample2),
    donor_1 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", donor_2, donor_1),
    donor_2 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", donor_1, donor_2),
    tissue_1 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", tissue_2, tissue_1),
    tissue_2 = ifelse(donor_1 == "Donor_B", tissue_1, tissue_2)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(donor_1 != donor_2 & tissue_1 == tissue_2) %>%
  distinct(Sample1, Sample2, .keep_all = TRUE)

print("Cross-donor correlations within the same tissue:")
print(cross_donor_correlations)
```
```{r}
# correlations between different tissues within same donor (within-donor, cross-tissue)
within_donor_correlations <- correlation_df %>%
  filter(donor_1 == donor_2 & tissue_1 != tissue_2) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    tissue_pair = paste(sort(c(tissue_1, tissue_2)), collapse = "_")
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  distinct(donor_1, tissue_pair, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(donor_1, donor_2) %>% 
  select(-tissue_pair)

print("Within-donor correlations across different tissues:")
print(within_donor_correlations)
```
```{r}
cross_donor_avg <- cross_donor_correlations %>%
  group_by(tissue_1) %>%
  summarise(avg_cross_donor_correlation = mean(Correlation))

cat("Average cross-donor correlations within the same tissue:")
cat(capture.output(glimpse(cross_donor_avg)), sep = "\n")
```

```{r}
within_donor_avg <- within_donor_correlations %>%
  group_by(donor_1) %>%
  summarise(avg_within_donor_correlation = mean(Correlation))

cat("Average within-donor correlations across different tissues:")
cat(capture.output(glimpse(within_donor_avg)), sep = "\n")
```
Spleen's cross-donor correlation (0.84) is higher than other tissues and even exceeds the within-donor, cross-tissue correlations. Typically expect cross-donor correlations within the same tissue to be lower than within-donor correlations across tissues due to donor-specific gene expression differences. It's likely that the spleen samples are suspicious sample swaps, but a more robust comparison would be use the BAM files for the spleen samples and compare with other samples like via Picard's [CrosscheckFingerprints tools](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037594711-CrosscheckFingerprints-Picard#--HAPLOTYPE_MAP ) (couldn't verify due to memory limitations within my system) .
